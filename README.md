# DFEFinalProject

◦ Why are we doing this?
The goal of this project is to develop a Spring Boot API that incorporates all foundational and practical modules that we studied in our training, 
using the supporting tools, techniques, and technologies, including Java, GitHub/GitBash, MySQL, H2, Postman, and Eclipse.
When we start working, we won't repeat our mistakes because we will have learned from them thanks to our independent efforts.
Since we've only done it once with our trainer before, practise is absolutely a must.

◦ How I expected the challenge to go.
I anticipate running through issues and errors and forgetting a few steps.
But because I am aware of who I am, I know that I will push myself to complete the task entirely.
I've always attempted to use Google and other resources to discover solutions, so I'm confident I can do the same for this project.

◦ What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
The things I fixed on my own, which was so satisfying, are what went well.
Because I occasionally had to wait a long time to see my trainer, since only one was there, I was forced to come up with my own answers, and I'm proud of it.
Several things went wrong, including the branches and committing, the missing classes and files, forgetting a semicolon, and several more, 
but the most important thing is that I finished it.
        
◦ Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
I would definitely increase the difficulty since I assumed it needed to adhere to the instructions from the model we constructed during training week.
It's not an excuse, but it can be challenging to fully comprehend assignments when English is your second language.
I would also make better use of the Jira board, which has been a really helpful tool to me. I can now understand how to use it more effectively.
I'm sure that what I'll do from here on out is practise and practise so that I can thoroughly comprehend each phase of the procedure.
